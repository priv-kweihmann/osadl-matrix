## Usage

### Using builtin functions

```python
import osadl_matrix

result = osadl_matrix.is_compatible("BSD-3-Clause", "MIT")
# result is either
# True - licenses are compatible
# False - licenses are *NOT* compatible

result = osadl_matrix.get_compatibility("GPL-2.0-only", "MIT")
# result is either
# osadl_matrix.OSADLCompatibility.YES - licenses are compatible
# osadl_matrix.OSADLCompatibility.NO - licenses are *NOT* compatible
# osadl_matrix.OSADLCompatibility.UNKNOWN - license compatibility is uncertain
# osadl_matrix.OSADLCompatibility.CHECKDEP - compatibility has depencies that need to be checked
# osadl_matrix.OSADLCompatibility.UNDEF - at least one of the licenses are not present in the OSADL matrix

result = osadl_matrix.supported_licenses()
# result is a set of supported license (identifiers)
```

### Using the raw data

```python
import csv

import osadl_matrix

with open(osadl_matrix.OSADL_MATRIX) as csvinput:
    creader = csv.reader(csvinput, delimiter=',', quotechar='"')
    for row in creader:
        print(row)
```

or as json

```python
import json

import osadl_matrix

with open(osadl_matrix.OSADL_MATRIX_JSON) as jsoninput:
    cnt = json.read(jsoninput)
    print(cnt)
